This section is to provide useful help in migrating your OpenSIPS installations from the 1.8 branch to the 1.9 branch.

You can find the all the new additions in 1.9.0 release compiled [under this page](https://www.opensips.org/About/Version-1-9-0). Overviewing it may help you understanding the migration / update process.

## DB migration

You can migrate your 1.8.x DB to the 1.9.0 format by using the **opensipsdbctl** tool :
```text

   # opensipsdbctl migrate opensips_1_8 opensips_1_9
   or
   # osipsconsole 
   > migrate opensips_1_8 opensips_1_9
   > quit
   # 

```
where :
* opensips_1_8 is the existing DB name corresponding to version 1.8.x format
* opensips_1_9 is the DB name to be created for 1.9 format

> [!NOTE]
> * the old database will not be deleted, altered or changed - it will not be touched at all
> * new database will be created and data from old DB will be imported into it

> [!NOTE]
> * Due to the latest changes in the RTPProxy module, the *nh_sockets* table has been renamed to *rtpproxy_sockets*.

> [!NOTE]
> * Due to some improvements in the Dialplan module, the *match_len* column that was specifying the length of the match column has been removed. Also, a new column, named *match_flags*, has been added to indicate whether the pattern matching should be done case sensitive or insensitive. The default value is 0 - *case sensitive*).

> [!NOTE]
> The migration tool is available only for MYSQL databases!

## Script migration

* The **match_len_col** parameter from the DIALPLAN was removed and is considered obsolete. The length of the matching expression can be directly computed by OpenSIPS, so no need for it to be explicitly declared in the Database.
* The old **perlvdb** module was renamed to **DB_PERLVDB** in order to respect the database modules naming convention.
* 1.9 supports named flags instead of just Integer flags. The migration to named flags affects all flag related functions and the module parameters used for defining flags (like flag to enable sip tracing, etc). This change is 100% backward compatible, but you will get some warning about deprecation of the ID based flags.
* parameters **db_url** and **xcap_table** from **xcap_client** modules moved to **xcap** module, with same name, meaning and functionality.
* Flag pseudo-variables `$mF`, `$sF`, `$bF` have been removed, and `$mf`, `$sf`, `$bf` are now Read-Only
