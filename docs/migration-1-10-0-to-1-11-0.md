## DB migration

You can migrate your 1.10.x MySQL DB to the 1.11.0 format by using the **opensipsdbctl** tool :
```text

   # opensipsdbctl migrate opensips_1_10 opensips_1_11
   or
   # osipsconsole 
   > migrate opensips_1_10 opensips_1_11
   > quit
   # 

```
where :
* opensips_1_10 is the existing DB name corresponding to version 1.10.x format
* opensips_1_11 is the DB name to be created for 1.11 format

> [!NOTE]
> * the old database will not be deleted, altered or changed - it will not be touched at all
> * new database will be created and data from old DB will be imported into it

> [!NOTE]
> The migration tool is available only for MYSQL databases!

## Script migration

* **timeout_avp** parameter from the **dialog** module was removed. Functionality was kept via the new `$DLG_timeout` variable, which is R/W, and can be set an any time ( before matching the dialog or at any time after )
* **gw_attrs_avp** , **rule_attrs_avp** , **carrier_attrs_avp** parameters from the **drouting** module were removed. Now the script writer can provide  pseudovariables ( AVPs, regular vars, etc ) when calling the do_routing()/use_next_gw() functions, where the appropriate attrs will get populated. All parameters are optional. Any of them may be ignored,provided the necessary separation marks "," are properly placed.    
* **set_rtp_proxy_set()** function and **rtpp_sock_pvar** parameter from **rtpproxy** module were removed. The script writer can now pass all the info ( the RTPProxy set to be used as well as a PVAR to store the actual RTPProxy used for the call ) directly when calling the rtpproxy_offer() / rtpproxy_answer() etc type functions
* **fr_timer_avp** and **fr_inv_timer_avp** parameters from the **TM** module were removed. New `$T_fr_timeout` and `$T_fr_inv_timeout` exported pseudovariables have been added as a drop-in replacement.
* **attrs_pvar** parameter from the **dialplan** module was removed. The script writer can now pass a pseudovariable to be populated with the diaplan rule attrs when calling dp_translate()
