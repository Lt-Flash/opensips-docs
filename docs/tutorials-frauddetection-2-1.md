## Introduction

Fraudulent calls have been a part of VoIP since its very beginnings. Typically, there are two ways through which a malicious user can gain permission to place calls through a VoIP platform: *account hijacking* and *weak platform security*.

The module provides a way of detecting suspicious calls from the same users to the same destinations might would otherwise likely end up costing the affected VoIP account (or the VoIP provider!) considerable amounts of money. This is done by closely monitoring a set of call-related parameters for each **[user,destination]** pair, together with sets of provisioned alerting thresholds.

## Module Overview
### Functionality

With the help of the dialog module, fraud_detection is able to monitor the following call-related statistics for each *[user,destination]* pair:

* calls-per-minute
* call duration
* total calls
* concurrent calls
* consecutive calls to the same destination
*Note: the above statistics require a user-provisioned time interval to be sampled upon (see 'Table provisioning' below)*

### DB provisioning
#### Table creation
In order to create the **fraud_detection** table, first make sure your *opensipsctlrc* file contains the desired SQL engine, DB name and access credentials:

```text

    vim /usr/local/etc/opensips/opensipsctlrc

```

Now you can add the extra OpenSIPS tables:

```text

    opensipsdbctl extra

```

#### Table provisioning

The following is an example of a fraud detecting profile for destination prefix **"99"**. Note that all of the rules below are part of the same profile: **1**.
```sql

INSERT INTO fraud_detection(profileid, prefix, start_hour, end_hour, daysoftheweek, cpm_warning, cpm_critical, call_duration_warning, \
call_duration_critical, total_calls_warning, total_calls_critical, concurrent_calls_warning, concurrent_calls_critical, \
sequential_calls_warning, sequential_calls_critical) VALUES(1, '99', '09:00', '17:00', 'Mon-Fri', 3, 5, 7200, 13200, 16, 35, 3, 5, 6, 20), \
(1, '99', '17:00', '23:59', 'Mon-Fri', 3, 5, 9600, 16000, 21, 35, 3, 5, 8, 26), \
(1, '99', '00:00', '09:00', 'Mon-Fri', 3, 4, 4800, 9600, 10, 20, 3, 4, 5, 15), \
(1, '99', '00:00', '23:59', 'Sat,Sun', 3, 5, 11400, 17400, 24, 40, 3, 5, 12, 30);

```

| **rule id** | **profile id** | **prefix** | **start hour** | **end hour** | **days of the week** | **cpm warning** | **cpm critical** | **call duration warning** | **call duration critical** | **total calls warning** | **total calls critical** | **concurrent calls warning** | **concurrent calls critical** | **sequential calls warning** | **sequential calls critical** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  2 | 1 | 99 | 17:00 | 23:59 | Mon-Fri | 3 | 5 | 9600 | 16000 | 21 | 35 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 26 |

**fraud_detection table example**

  

Data interpretation:

* **Rule 1** will match from **09:00 to 17:00**, **Monday to Friday**. It will trigger a **fraud warning** event/error each time a user either:
  * makes **between 3 and 4 calls within one minute**
  * makes one call lasting **between 7200 and 13119 seconds**
  * makes **between 16 and 34 calls** in the current interval
  * makes **between 3 and 4 simultaneous calls**
  * makes **between 6 and 19 consecutive calls** to the same destination
* The same **Rule 1** will trigger a **fraud critical** event/error each time a user either:
  * makes **5 or more calls within one minute**
  * makes one call lasting **13120 or more seconds**
  * makes **35 or more calls** in the current interval
  * makes **5 or more simultaneous calls**
  * makes **20 or more consecutive calls** to the same destination

### How does it work?

As stated in the Chapter 1 of the [documentation](/modules/2-1/fraud_detection), the module monitors 5 parameters which are updated every time the ***check_fraud*** function is called (i.e each time a call is made). For each set of number, prefix and username
, unique values of the 5 parameters will be kept and monitored. Each time a value is altered, it will be compared to a threshold value. There are two threshold values for each of the 5 parameters (warning and critical thresholds), thus making a total of 10 values. This threshold values along with a time interval in which they are applicable form a so-called *rule*. It's the admin's job to provide the *fraud rules* to OpenSIPs through the db interface.

## Example script

Firstly, we load the dependencies and the **fraud_detection** module
```c

loadmodule "drouting.so"
loadmodule "dialog.so"
loadmodule "fraud_detection.so"

```

Then we set the mandatory parameters
```c

modparam("drouting", "db_partitions_url", "mysql://root:123456@localhost/opensips")
modparam("drouting", "use_partitions", 1)
modparam("fraud_detection", "db_url", "mysql://root:123456@localhost/opensips")

```

Optionally, we load the event_route module to bind the warning and critical events to an event route
```c

loadmodule "event_route.so"

```

Let's assume that for each INITIAL INVITE we want to check and update the fraud parameters
```text

route{
	if (has_totag()) {
		loose_route();
	}
	else {
		record_route();
		check_fraud("$fU", "$rU", "1");
		if ($rc < 0) {
			xlog("Problems for user $fU rc=$rc\n");
		}
	}
	t_relay();
}

```
Some issues can be identified on the spot, hence the check of the return code. Please refer to the module's documentation for the return code's meaning.
Please note the last parameter of the *check_fraud* function: it's the profile id we set earlier.

Optionally, we can bind the warning and critical events
```text

event_route[E_FRD_WARNING] {

	fetch_event_params("$var(param);$var(val);$var(thr);$var(user);$var(number);$var(ruleid)");
	xlog("E_FRD_WARNING: $var(param);$var(val);$var(thr);$var(user);$var(number);$var(ruleid)\n");
}

event_route[E_FRD_CRITICAL] {

	fetch_event_params("$var(param);$var(val);$var(thr);$var(user);$var(number);$var(ruleid)");
	xlog("E_FRD_CRITICAL: $var(param);$var(val);$var(thr);$var(user);$var(number);$var(ruleid)\n");
}

```
