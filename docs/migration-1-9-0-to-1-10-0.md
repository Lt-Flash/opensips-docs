## DB migration

You can migrate your 1.9.x DB to the 1.10.0 format by using the **opensipsdbctl** tool :
```text

   # opensipsdbctl migrate opensips_1_9 opensips_1_10
   or
   # osipsconsole 
   > migrate opensips_1_9 opensips_1_10
   > quit
   # 

```
where :
* opensips_1_9 is the existing DB name corresponding to version 1.9.x format
* opensips_1_8 is the DB name to be created for 1.10 format

> [!NOTE]
> * the old database will not be deleted, altered or changed - it will not be touched at all
> * new database will be created and data from old DB will be imported into it

> [!NOTE]
> The migration tool is available only for MYSQL databases!

## Script migration

* SCA support for the **presence_callinfo** module is not by default activated. If you want to disable it, you have to set the [disable_dialog_support_for_sca](https://www.opensips.org/wwww/opensips/org/html/modules/1/10/x/presence_callinfo/html#id249970) on **1**.
* The **auth_username_avp**, **auth_realm_avp** and **auth_password_avp** parameters have been moved from the **uac** module to **uac_auth**. See [this FAQ](/modules/1-10/uac#id294170) for more information.
